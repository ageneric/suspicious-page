    <h1>A Totally Legitimate Phishing Page</h1>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 3.5em;">Oh dear. Looks like you've clicked on a suspicious link!</p>
    <p>Can never be too cautious, right? The Internet's a pretty dangerous place.</p>
    <p>Luckily this one's safe. Though, maybe you knew that; after all - <a id="current-page-address" href=""><script type="text/javascript">
document.write(window.location.href);
    </script></a> - is pretty trustable. I probably could have put this somewhere more suspicious. Maybe tomorrow?</p>
