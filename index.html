    <h1>Totally Legitimate Phishing Page</h1>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 3.5em;">Oh dear. Looks like you've clicked on a suspicious link!</p>
    <p>Can never be too cautious, right? The Internet's a pretty dangerous place. Luckily this one's safe.</p>
    <p>Maybe you knew that; after all - <a id="current-page-address" href=""><script type="text/javascript">
document.write(window.location.href);
        </script></a> - is pretty trustable. To be honest, I probably should've put this somewhere more suspicious. Maybe tomorrow.</p>
